Create a 3x3 grid of cinematic shots depicting a sequence showing a female character, similar to the one in the provided image, running out of a motel parking lot with a look of panic and distress on her face, capturing a variety of time passing throughout the evening. Each shot should reflect details such as light reflecting very light microscopic dust, hyperreal depth, and volumetric light rays. The output specifications should include being shot on ARRI Alexa 65 + Panavision Primo 50mm, using ProRes_4444XQ format, with 8K HDRi output. Aim for zero noise with perfect white balance, and include anamorphic depth of field (DOF) with realistic anamorphic lens bloom. Ensure a high-end color grade for sensor fidelity and hyper-sharp tonality. Include the attached image as a reference in the request.
